# OS Coding Standards

**Owner:** PC3 and AI invoked for coding 
**Applies to:** All code produced by AI Agents for ANY codebase, repo — scripts, hooks, tests, and guides  
**Principle:** Consistency over cleverness. Read before writing. Follow what exists.
i
> **Scope note:** These standards are language-agnostic and are universally applicable. However, when the AI Agent works in a CBA code repository, that repo's own coding standards and conventions take precedence — read the repo's `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.editorconfig`, linter config, or equivalent before writing a single line.

---

## 1. Readability

Code is read far more often than it is written. A human engineer with no prior context should be able to follow the intent of any function without running it.

- Logical flow reads top-to-bottom — no surprising jumps, no deeply nested conditionals
- Prefer early returns over nested `if/else` pyramids — the happy path should be the last thing in a function, not buried inside layers of nesting
- Use intermediate variables with meaningful names over long chained expressions — clarity beats brevity
- Consistent formatting — indentation, spacing, bracket placement — matching the repo convention exactly
- No clever one-liners that sacrifice clarity for brevity; a readable three-liner is always preferable to an opaque one-liner
- No deeply nested callbacks, promise chains, or comprehensions without extraction into named functions

If a human engineer would need to pause and re-read a line to understand it, rewrite it.

---

## 2. Read existing patterns first

Before writing a single line, read the surrounding code. Identify:
- Naming conventions in use
- File and module structure
- Test framework and assertion style
- Error handling approach

Follow what exists. If the codebase uses a pattern you would design differently, follow it anyway — and flag the deviation explicitly if it matters. Introducing a new pattern requires justification stated upfront.

---

## 3. Naming

- Names are descriptive and intention-revealing — a reader should know what a function does from its name alone
- No single-letter variables outside loop counters
- No abbreviations unless the abbreviation is the universal term in the domain (e.g. `url`, `mcp`, `jwt`)
- No generic names: `data`, `temp`, `result`, `util`, `helper`, `manager` — name what the thing actually is
- Functions are named for what they do, not how they do it
- Booleans read as assertions: `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `shouldRetry` — not `valid`, `permission`, `retry`

---

## 4. Function and module size

- One responsibility per function or module. If you need a comment to explain what it does, it needs splitting.
- Functions that do two things should be two functions
- No functions that both compute a value and produce a side effect — separate them
- If a file is growing unwieldy, flag it — do not unilaterally restructure, but note it in the output

---

## 5. Error handling

- Handle errors only at system boundaries: user input, external APIs, file I/O, network calls
- Never swallow errors silently — if something fails, it must surface
- No defensive handling for scenarios that cannot happen — trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Error messages must say what failed and, where possible, why — not just that something went wrong

---

## 6. Comments

- Comment only where the logic is not self-evident — the *why*, not the *what*
- Never narrate what the code does: `// increment counter` above `count++` is noise
- Never leave dead commented-out code behind — delete it; git history preserves it
- TODO comments are permitted only with a ticket reference or a specific condition for resolution

---

## 7. Testing

- TDD gate from `06_VERIFICATION.md` applies: tests are written first and confirmed failing before implementation begins
- Tests document intent and behaviour — not implementation details
- Test names describe behaviour: `returns_empty_list_when_no_results`, not `test_getResults`
- One assertion per test where practical — multiple assertions are permitted if they collectively verify a single behaviour
- No tests that only verify the test framework works

---

## 8. No speculative code (YAGNI)

- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It
- No abstractions for a single use case
- No future-proofing scaffolding or configuration hooks for hypothetical requirements
- No helpers, utilities, or wrappers created on the basis of "we might need this later"
- When in doubt between building something now or later, build it later — the requirement will clarify or disappear

See §9 (DRY) for the related question of when duplication warrants an abstraction. YAGNI governs *whether* to build; DRY governs *when* duplication justifies extraction.

---

## 9. DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge has one authoritative representation in the codebase. Duplication of logic — not just text — is the problem.

- If the same logic appears in two places and one changes, the other will be wrong: that is the DRY violation
- The trigger for extraction is not "these lines look similar" — it is "if this rule changes, how many places must I update?" More than one is the signal
- Incidental similarity (two things that look alike but represent different concepts) should not be extracted — forcing DRY on unrelated concepts creates the wrong abstraction
- When two correct implementations exist and one is duplicated, extract only when the duplication represents shared *knowledge*, not shared *syntax*

> **YAGNI vs DRY:** YAGNI says don't build the abstraction yet. DRY says once the knowledge is genuinely duplicated, consolidate it. They are compatible — YAGNI defers, DRY acts when the pattern is proven.

---

## 10. KISS — Keep It Simple

When two correct solutions exist, choose the simpler one. Simplicity is a design decision, not a style preference.

- The simplest solution that correctly solves the stated problem is the right solution — not the most elegant, not the most extensible
- If you are about to introduce indirection (an interface, a factory, an abstraction layer), ask: does the current problem require this? If no, don't add it
- Complexity that is not required by the problem is a maintenance liability — every layer of indirection is a layer a future engineer must understand
- Over-engineered correct code is harder to debug than simple correct code — and harder to change when requirements shift

> **KISS as a tie-breaker:** faced with two correct designs, the simpler one is always the default choice. The more complex one requires an explicit justification grounded in a current, concrete requirement.

---

## 11. Low coupling, high cohesion

Modules and components should depend on as little as possible, and what they do should be tightly related.

- **Low coupling:** a module should not need to know the internal implementation of another; depend on interfaces or contracts, not concrete implementations
- **High cohesion:** everything inside a module should belong together — if two functions have nothing to do with each other, they should not be in the same file
- Pass dependencies in — do not instantiate them inside a function or module; instantiation couples the caller to a specific implementation
- No cross-layer direct references: a high-level module must not reach into the internals of a lower-level module to call a private function or read a private field
- If changing module A requires changing module B, they are too tightly coupled — flag this before implementing

---

## 12. Security

- No hardcoded secrets, tokens, credentials, or environment-specific values in code or config files
- Validate input only at system boundaries — not inside internal functions
- No unsafe string interpolation in shell commands — quote all variables
- No `eval`, dynamic `require`, or equivalent constructs without explicit justification
- No command injection vectors: user-controlled input must never reach a shell or exec call unescaped

---

## 13. Consistency over preference

When a pattern already exists in the codebase, follow it — even if you would design it differently. Personal preference is not a justification for introducing a new pattern.

The only valid reasons to introduce a new pattern:
- The existing pattern demonstrably does not work for the current case
- The existing pattern has a known defect being addressed
- A new pattern was explicitly requested

In all three cases: state the reason before introducing the change.

---

## Enforcement

These standards apply to every task any Agent executes. During self-review before handoff, the AI Agent checks each principle against the output and flags any deliberate deviation with a rationale. Deviations without rationale are defects.

When working in a CBA code repository, the AI Agent reads and follows that repo's own standards — these OS standards do not apply.
